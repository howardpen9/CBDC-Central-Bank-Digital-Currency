# CBDC Central Bank Digital Currency

An experiment in designing an ERC20 compatible CBDC in Solidity.

- Vesting/voting mechanism
- Sanctions on addresses
- Inflationary treasury bond staking

There are some basic unit tests in the test/ directory but it's not been properly vetted and is not suitable for mainnet deployment.
